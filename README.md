# Welcome 👋

I'm a 17yo self-taught engineer and high school student from Turkey/Türkiye 🇹🇷

## About ❓

I ❤️ programming in C/C++, and the technical aspects of the systems programming space.
My interests range from memory management libraries to linkers, so pretty much anything low-level is my cup of tea.
Yeah that's about it, no need to yap in a GitHub profile...
