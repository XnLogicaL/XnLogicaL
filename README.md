:wave: Hello, I'm XnLogicaL or CEO as some people know me.

I'm a self-taught systems programmer and freelance game developer (on Roblox) and a high school student from Turkey.
I have a deep passion for programming and open-source development.
I'm also possibly the first person to enjoy coding in C++, by far my favorite language.
