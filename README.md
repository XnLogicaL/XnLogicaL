:wave: Hello, I'm XnLogicaL or CEO as some people know me.

I'm a self taught programmer and I'm currently attending high school.
I live in Ankara, Turkey (TÃ¼rkiye) and my timezone is UTC+3


I have a deep passion of coding and developing apps and games. I've been coding since I was 10 years old.
I also do freelancing on Roblox as a game developer, and I've worked on more than 100 projects on Roblox.
I'm also always learning other programming languages as you can see below, as I'm running for a career in software development.

I also like to play games in my free time.
