:wave: Hello, I'm XnLogicaL or CEO as some people know me.

I'm a self taught programmer and I'm currently attending high school.
I live in Turkey (Türkiye) and my timezone is UTC+3 or GMT+2.


I have a deep passion for coding and developing apps and games. I've been coding since I was 10 years old.
I also do freelancing on Roblox as a game developer, and I've worked on more than 100 projects on Roblox.
I'm always learning other programming languages as you can see below, it's never too late to learn!
I mostly post open-source passion projects here, so don't expect anything crazy (for now :D)

I also like to play games and watch sci-fi (mainly Star Trek) in my free time.
