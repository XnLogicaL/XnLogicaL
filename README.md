# Welcome 👋

I'm a 16-yo self-taught engineer and high school student from Turkey/Türkiye 🇹🇷

## About ❓

I ❤️ programming in general, and enjoy the technical aspects of the systems programming space.
Interested in compilers, interpreters, among other things.
That's about it, no need to yap here..

**See pinned projects for cool stuff*
