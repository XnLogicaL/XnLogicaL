# Welcome to my profile ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 17yo self-taught Systems Programmer and Freelance Game Developer from Turkey/TÃ¼rkiye.

I really enjoy programming in C/C++, which I use to build most of my projects on GitHub.
My interests range from compilers to memory management libraries, so pretty much anything low-level is my cup of tea.
Always willing to learn new things, explore new libraries, and ofcourse, debug more segfaults...
