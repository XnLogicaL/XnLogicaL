# Welcome to my profile 👋

I'm a 17yo high school student from Turkey/Türkiye 🇹🇷

*Self-proclaimed Systems Programmer and Freelance Game Developer*

## About ❓

I ❤️ programming in C/C++, and the technical aspects of the systems programming space.
My interests range from memory management libraries to linkers, so pretty much anything low-level is my cup of tea.

*Always willing to learn new things, explore new libraries, and of course, debug more segfaults...* 🤕

## Stuff I use 💻

Things that I use on a daily basis.

- GitHub: obviously
- C/C++: My goto programming languages that I use for systems projects.
- CMake: I use CMake to build my C/C++ projects, not out of preference but necessity.
- VSCode: My main text editor that I use for pretty much everything. (too lazy to switch to vim)
- clangd: C/C++ language server I use inside my text editor.
- clang-format: C/C++ formatter that I use in every project to keep the codebase clean.
- gcc/g++: My preferred C/C++ compilers.
- gdb: My preferred C/C++ debugger.
- WSL2: To be able to keep using Windows while having access to the amazing tooling of Linux (Ubuntu distro specifically), without any form of dual-booting!
- Alacritty: My goto terminal for interfacing with WSL2.
- Discord: I use it primarily for communications, feel free to contact me! (username: `ceo_oftaxfraud`)

*Looking forward to keep extending this list further and further!*
