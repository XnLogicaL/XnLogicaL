# Welcome üëã

I'm a 17yo self-taught engineer and high school student from Turkey/T√ºrkiye üáπüá∑

## About ‚ùì

I ‚ù§Ô∏è programming in C/C++, and the technical aspects of the systems programming space.
My interests range from memory management libraries to linkers, so pretty much anything low-level is my cup of tea.

*Always willing to learn new things, explore new libraries, and of course, debug more segfaults...* ü§ï

## Stuff I use üíª

Things that I use on a daily basis

- [GitHub](https://github.com): Obviously
- [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language))/[C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B): My goto programming languages that I use for systems projects.
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/): My preferred build system for C/C++ projects.
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/): My main text editor that I use for pretty much everything. (too lazy to switch to vim)
- [clangd](https://clangd.llvm.org/): C/C++ language server I use inside my text editor.
- [clang-format](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html): C/C++ formatter that I use in every project to keep the codebase clean.
- [gcc/g++](https://gcc.gnu.org/): My preferred C/C++ compilers.
- [gdb](www.sourceware.org/gdb/): My preferred C/C++ debugger.
- [WSL2](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL): To be able to keep using Windows while having access to the amazing tooling of Linux (the Ubuntu distro specifically).
